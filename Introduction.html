											<h1>Here is my self introduction<br />
											edited by HTML5 UP</h1>
										</header>
										<p>My name is Suraj Chaudhary, and I am originally from Nepal. I am currently residing in South Korea, where I am pursuing a Bachelor's degree in Computer Engineering. My passion for technology began early, which led me to complete a Diploma in Computer Engineering in Nepal before continuing my higher education abroad. During my diploma studies, I also had the opportunity to work part-time as a developer at an IT company. This hands-on experience not only enhanced my technical knowledge but also allowed me to apply theoretical concepts in real-world projects, strengthening my problem-solving and programming skills.

Living and studying in South Korea has given me exposure to a global learning environment and advanced technological practices. I am constantly seeking to learn new technologies and improve my expertise in software development. I come from a small but loving family of threeâ€”my mother, my father, and me. Their constant support and encouragement have played a key role in shaping my academic and personal journey.
